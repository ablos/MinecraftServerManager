# Minecraft Server Manager

This is a project I created mainly to use for me and my friend. This way we can easily synchronize files and run the server. I did this purely for a fun project and feel free to use it in any way you want.

This app has a complete server console and synchronizes all files using Google Drive.

-------------------

Please be aware that you should use a completely empty Google Drive for this, or you will lose all files in the drive (or they will be all downloaded to your pc).
Making changes to the server files should be made while the application is running (console window should be shown). This will make sure it will upload the changes to the drive.
